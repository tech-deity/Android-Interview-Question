## Android Components
### Explain briefly all the Android application components

**App components** are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app.
There are four different types of app components :

* **Activities** - An activity is the entry point for app interaction with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface.
* **Services** - A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons. It is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes.
* **Broadcast receivers** - A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements.
* **Content providers** - A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access.
